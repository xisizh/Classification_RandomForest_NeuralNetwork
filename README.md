# Classification_RandomForest_NeuralNetwork

In this exercise, I constructed two distinctly different machine learning models, Random Forest model and Neural Network model (Multilayer Perceptron), to predict the positive class probability. 

During the modeling process, stratified sampling for training/test- ing data splitting, feature engineering for categorical/missing values and columns, and cross-validating with random search for tuning parameters, are performed to arrive at the final model. 

For the final random forest model, the training misclassification error is 0.02, the testing misclassification error is 0.06 and the testing AUC is 0.97. For the final neural network model, the training misclassification error is 0.01, the testing misclassification error is 0.02, and the testing AUC is 0.99.
